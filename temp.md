- [ ] move this to Note?
- [x] how to sort items?
  - seems can not do it on UI, have to sort array first(make a copy of state data),
    - then use sorted array to map to jsx
  - [ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43572436/sort-an-array-of-objects-in-react-and-render-them/43572944)

## basic

- background
  - react is a js library(though behave like a framework) published by facebook
  - SPA web app
  - the 'V' in MVC
  - name convention
    - capital first char for component name
- virtual DOM
- state
  - component can have state which is an object that determines how that component renders and behaves
  - we can also have 'application level' state by using a state manager like 'Redux' or reacts own 'context api'
    - which can be used to share data between components
- uses Webpack but needs no configuration form you
- comes bundled with a dev server with hot reload
- prerequisite
  - nodejs
  - react developer tools (chrome web store)
- react library
  - react-dom, load components into browser
  - react-native, build app for mobile
  - react-scripts, dev server related
- babel
  - translate ES6(or later) to lower version for compatible
- webpack (v4)
  - what for
    - smaller and faster build
  - bundle source files into one js file
  - webpack config file
    - entry: `.src/index.js`
    - output
      - path: `path.join(__dirname, '/dist')`
      - filename: `index_bundle.js` //can be any name you want
    - module
      - rules
        - test: `/\.js$/` //end with .js
        - exclude: `/node_modules/`
        - use: `{ loader: 'babel-loader' }`
    - plugins: `[ new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: './src/index.html' })]`
- service worker
  - for progressive web app and offline content
- lifecycle methods
  - render()
  - componentDidMount()
    - do ajax call inner this func
- events
- JSX - html code block
  - use 'className' instead of 'class'

## CLI

```sh
# install dependencies
npm install

# bundles the app into static files for prod
npm run build

# start dev server
npm start

# start test runner
npm test

# one step - create app (under current folder) - this won't install react globally
npx create-react-app .

# step by step - with webpack and babel
npm init --yes         # create package.json
npm i react react-dom  # react libraries (prod only need these 2)
# dev dependencies
npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli
npm i --save-dev babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react html-webpack-plugin
# create file in root folder and setup config
touch webpack.config.js
# create app entry files
touch ./src/index.html
touch ./src/index.js
# add <div id='app'></div> to <body>  # react-dom will looking for this elem and insert react view
# create file for babel presets in root folder
touch .babelrc  # add { "presets": ["env", "react"] } to file
# setup index.js - hookup react render with dom elem
# main line
ReactDom.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
# impl App.js
// you app logic
# modify package.json, set following entries
scripts.start: "webpack-dev-server --mode development --hot --open"
scripts.build: "webpack --mode production"

# removes this tool and copies build dependencies, config files and scripts into the app dir
# if you do this, you can't go back
# npm run eject

```
